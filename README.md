# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR (Hot Module Replacement) and some ESLint rules.

## Features

- Fast Refresh: Provides instant feedback during development.
- Optimized Build: Uses Vite for lightning-fast builds.
- ESLint Configuration: Includes basic linting rules for code quality.
- Flexible Plugin Support: Supports both Babel and SWC for transpilation.

## Available Plugins

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) - Uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh.
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) - Uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh, offering better performance in some cases.
